The RT database must be updated to match your instrument methods!
Must include a column for 'InchI' and 'RetentionTime'. 

MassBankEU and mzCloud .csv files are used for MS/MS database lookups and 
the SusDat .csv file is used as a suspect list. All can be updated to fit 
your needs as long as InChIKey's are used.
